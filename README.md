This is a game called pig dice whereby one plays around with probability by rolling a die (or dice) against another player in the race to see who'll reach 100 points first since the points received from the dice are tallied.

Output Example: 5

* When the button "Hold" is pressed the accummulated points should be tallied to the total score and turn changed to next player.
