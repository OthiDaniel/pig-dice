## Description
This is a game called pig dice whereby one plays around with probability by rolling a die (or dice) against another player in the race to see who'll reach 100 points first since the points received from the dice are tallied.

# BDD
-   When the button "Roll" is clicked a random number should be outputted representing the die value.
-   When the button "Hold" is pressed the accummulated points should be tallied to the total score and turn changed to next player.
-   If Die brings back 1 as the value then accummulated score is reversed to zero and turn changed to next player.
